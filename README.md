# PolymerArchitecture.jl

**PolymerArchitecture.jl** provides a *graph* representation of the polymer architecture. Based on such representation, equivalent sub-architectures and semi-equivalent sub-architectures of a non-cyclic block copolymer chain can be identified automatically. Equivalent sub-architectures and semi-equivalent sub-architectures are useful for reducing the computational cost of polymer field-theoretic simulations.

To construct a graph representation, polymers defined in the [Polymer.jl](https://github.com/liuyxpp/Polymer.jl) is required.

*Warning: Be aware that this package is currently under active development. The interface is highly unstable and subjects to change frequently.*

## Usage

```julia
julia> using Polymer, PolymerArchitecture
```

Documentation is not available yet. However, one can consult the test codes reside in the `test` folder to learn more.
